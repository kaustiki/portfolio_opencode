# Portfolio Project - Akurati Kaustiki

## Quick Reference

| Item | Location |
|------|----------|
| Owner | Akurati Kaustiki (Computer Science Engineer, M.Tech AI/ML) |
| Goal | Attract recruiters/employers in AI/ML, backend systems |
| Content | `plans/data.md` |
| Tech Stack | `plans/requirements.md` (Plain HTML/CSS/JS) |
| Design System | `plans/design.md` |
| Implementation | `plans/todo.md` |

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5** - Semantic markup
- **CSS3** - Custom properties for theming
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - ES6+ modules
- **JetBrains Mono** - Single font for everything

## Workflow

### Phase Execution (One at a time)

For each phase, follow this sequence:

1. **Read `plans/todo.md`** - Identify the next incomplete phase (first phase with unchecked items)
2. **Read `plans/requirements.md`** - Understand technical requirements for that phase
3. **Read `plans/design.md`** - Ensure design constraints are followed
4. **Implement** - Build all todo items for the current phase
5. **Report completion** - Summarize what was implemented
6. **STOP and wait** - Wait for user to test manually
7. **Handle response**:
   - If user says "test pass" or "working" → Update `plans/todo.md` (check off completed items), then proceed to next phase
   - If user requests improvements → Execute improvements, then repeat from step 6

**CRITICAL**: 
- Never proceed to next phase without explicit user approval
- Always update todo.md after phase is approved
- Follow design.md constraints strictly (monochrome, JetBrains Mono, minimal animations)

### Design Constraints
All implementations must follow `plans/design.md`:
- Pure monochrome (black/white only)
- JetBrains Mono font only
- Minimal animations (no bouncy/spinning)
- Code-like components (4px radius max)
- No gradients, shadows, or decorative elements
